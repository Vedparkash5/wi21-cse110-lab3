                <hr>
                    <p>Hello, my name is <b>Vedparkash Singh</b> and I am a college Junior at UCSD! <br>I study Computer Science and Cognitive Science, the two subjects seem to be miles apart from each other but they both are actually interconnected throughout history.<br> Especially when it came to Artificial Inteligence, starting from the 1950's most computer scientists also studied Cognitive Science in order to model their programs on the Human Brain

                        I personally have modeled my who life and philosophy on a lot of different quotes. By far, the most influential quote is the one that my <em> grandfather</em> gave me. I had called him when I failed a class and he decided to tech me how to make butter. He said,
                        
                    </p>
                    <aside> <i>  "in order to make butter, you start off with milk, and you let the milk go bad and turn into yogurt, and from the yogurt you make butter. Just like in making butter, life has to go bad and you use that opportunity to make something new and good out of your life." </i>

                    </aside> 
                        <p>When I started coding, I remember the first line I wrote was</p>
                      <pre><code>System.out.println("Hello World") </code></pre>
                      <p>and I was so <strong>happy</strong> that I was a hacker now. After that, when I actually started taking classes I realized how much I really didn't know about programing. If you are more interested in other projects that I have created, you can check out the projects section that's linked here. I also love anime and anime review, my favorite reviewer is swayer7mage for the anime One Piece. Check out his latest video </p>
